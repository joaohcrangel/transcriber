# Transcriber

This project is a transcriber that converts audio to text. It uses speech recognition libraries to process audio files and generate accurate transcriptions.

## `index.js` File

The `index.js` file is the main entry point of the project. It contains the code responsible for:

1. Loading and configuring the necessary libraries.
2. Processing the input audio file.
3. Using the speech recognition library to transcribe the audio.
4. Saving the generated transcription to a text file.

### Structure of `index.js`

1. **Module Import**: Imports the necessary libraries for the transcriber to function.
2. **Configuration**: Defines the settings and parameters needed for audio processing.
3. **Audio Processing**: Loads the audio file and prepares it for transcription.
4. **Transcription**: Uses the speech recognition library to convert the audio to text.
5. **Save Transcription**: Saves the transcribed text to an output file.
